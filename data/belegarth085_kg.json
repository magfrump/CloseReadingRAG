Bolts fail for hit if there is significant residual pain for at least ten seconds after impact. Another measure is if the bolt back would tolerate getting shot in the head with the bolt. 2. If a bolt fails on one back, it goes to retest with another back. If it fails a second time, then the bolt fails.k. Rotate your bolt backs. Getting shot by a lot of bolts in the same spots eventually makes all the bolts feel bad.l. Watch for excessive bounceback. Excessive bounceback is defined as the bolt hitting the back and bouncing either to or past the shooter. Questionable bolts should be retested against a different back. Failing that, it should be checked against a flat-faced shield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B. QUICK REFERE"}
